                    <p class="cursive">
                        The “cat pattern,” established very early in the evolution of modern mammals, was a successful one:
                        early cats were already typical in form at a time when the ancestors of most other modern mammalian
                        types were scarcely recognizable. They first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch
                        (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), and they have continued with remarkably little change into modern times.

                        The cat has long played a role in religion and witchcraft. In the Bible, “cat” is mentioned only in the
                        apocryphal Letter of Jeremiah. The cat figured prominently in the religions of Egypt, the Norse countries,
                        and various parts of Asia. The Egyptians had a cat-headed goddess named Bast (or Bastet). Thousands of cat
                        mummies have been discovered in Egypt, and there were even mouse mummies, presumably to provide food for
                        the cats. Often the cat has been associated with sorcery and witchcraft, and the superstitions regarding
                        cats are innumerable. Throughout the ages, cats have been more cruelly mistreated than perhaps any other
                        animal. Black cats in particular have long been regarded as having occult powers and as being the familiars
                        of witches.
